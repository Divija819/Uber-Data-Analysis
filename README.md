# Uber-Data-Analysis
A Machine Learning Project.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset. This is a data visualization project where we use visualisation 
libraries for understanding the data and for developing an intuition for understanding the customers who avail the trips. We are building a business 
model using which Uber can promote and develop their business.
The folder contains all the datasets(.csv files) and the code. The code has been written in anaconda jupyter notebook.
